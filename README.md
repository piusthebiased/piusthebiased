## Hi there, I'm Pius ðŸ‘‹
Hey, I'm Pius. I'm 17 years old. This account contains work that I've created over a series of years.

<!--- 
Congratulations. You've found a secret section in my about me! As a reward for being so nosy, here's a treat.

### Here are two stories I've told about my childhood.
**Story one:** My outlook on traditional schooling is bleak. If I ever wanted to do anything (in, say, public policy), going to university is a basic prerequisite to lead change in the contemporary world. I cannot express my desire to _not_ work in an office and instead spend my time on activities that necessitates meaningful change. Recently, I've had an itch to pursue these aforementioned activities after TA'ing/lecturing at a summer camp. In the program, there were a group of highly motivated students who are inteterested in quantum computing; I loved every moment of the program. This is my primary motivator to get into university, and thus, the driving factor of what I do/will do. This is why I did USACO, why I started these activities (e.g., chemical engineering, law research, quantum physics, computer science) at such a young age, why I put myself through so much strenous effort, and why I'll continue my path.

**Story two:** Growing up, I was very interested in building things. I was also very curious about understanding phenomena that didn't fit into my limited mental model of how the wolrd worked (e.g., how my remote control was able to communicate with my television despite being disconnected, how cars moved without somebody pushing them, or most curious of all, how did the computer work? what drew all the pictures on the screen and how was it possible to do it all so quickly as I interacted with it?). The interplay between my interest in building things and my interest in understanding them is core to much of what I do now, and what I did when I was younger. I coded in Scratch and Java throughout elementary school. In the fifth grade, I wrote an essay about graphine and what gave it its unique properties. Along with the essay, I built a little gizmo that would make sheets of graphine. In middle school, I coded some C for Arduino projects for a golf alignment tool and built a simple PCB for it too. By high school, I had started to tkae on more complicated projects and found less success in them. Though I was more capable, the scale of my interest and excitement seemed to always get agead of the amount of time I was able to commit to things, which ended up in three-day all nighters, and I would often find myself stuck or unmotivated in school because of my lack of progress -- this, along with other interpersonal and family issues, have led to the (relative) downfall of my academic career.

Towards the end of my high school career, something changed. In the same two weeks, three things happened to me. [redact]. Each of these things required my complete focus, and I gave that to ecah of them. I realized the extent to which success in doing hard things (physical, intellectual, and moral) was a choice for me to make with the application of my will. During this time, I did little to no schoolwork in school or out of it, and didn't always sleep as much as was healthy. Ultimately, it was worth it, because I leavned that if I applied myself to problems I wanted to solve or things I wanted to do, I could create a virtuous cycle of achievement, satisfaction, and focus.

These two stories were deeply confusing to me, because the contrast between my emotional and intellectual self, outside of school versus inside of school, was so stark.

When I returned to Virginia, a classmate of mine asked me if I was going to commit to university, and without a momentâ€™s thought, I answered that I wouldnâ€™t.

Later, I thought about why I responded so quickly. It wasnâ€™t that I didnâ€™t value learning or growth--I did, and still do. But my experiences in school had often left me feeling frustrated and disconnected. Saying no felt like a step toward taking control of my path, focusing on what I found meaningful, and moving away from a school of thought that didnâ€™t align with how I wanted to grow. So, in some sense, the reason I made the decision without any calculation of expected value or use of critical thinking was _to get a grip_, I suppose.

As many college applicants, professors, and parents will openly tell you, people donâ€™t usually attend schools based on soul-searching for what pedagogical program suits them best. In fact, most havenâ€™t done much exploring about how they learn best because of the degree to which even progressive education places students into more or less similar relationships to the presentation of ideas and work at understanding them. People often go to college based on which one is perceived by the most people to be the most impressive.

If, as a student, you struggle to understand or invest yourself in the form of learning you participate in, do the hard work of exploring how it is you learn and what it is you care about. Then take full responsibility for putting yourself in a position to succeed not just by other peopleâ€™s standards, but also by your own. At least in my experience, it has repeatedly surprised me how capable I am when I believe in my work because I am putting all of my energy and focus towards it as a result.

The choice not to backtrack on my statement that I would leave school represented a bet on something I had complete control over (my ability to build technology that helps people by exploiting my abilities and opportunities) and an abandonment of a system controlled by others that had a ten-year track record of running me into the ground.

This bet represented me making a proposition to myself about my future. The proposition was one that I will always trust myself completely to make the right call on.

To fail or do what you love.
