    <h2 style="margin-bottom:2px;">Carnegie Mellon Essays</h2>
    <p>During the c/o 2025 application cycle, I applied to Carnegie Mellon University for the Tepper School of Business. In retrospect, I believe these were not my <i>strongest</i> essays: the prose is all over the place, there's no consice theme, and there are basic grammatical errors. HOWEVER, the essays I thought were my strongest landed me on the waitlist at a less selective institution.</p>    
    <p>On that note, I think it's funny how the college application process pushed me towards such emotionally charged writing. I think my the quality of my writing decreased during my senior year of high school.</p>
    <hr><h4>1. Many students pursue college for a specific degree, career opportunity or personal goal. Whichever it may be, learning will be critical to achieve your ultimate goal. As you think ahead to the process of learning during your college years, how will you define a successful college experience?</h4>
    <p>After some thought, for me, there are three defining features of a successful college experience: depth of learning, personal growth, and the quality of the connections I make within the academic community. Plainly speaking, these choices are motivated by my requirement for interdisciplinary learning. My interests are rather diverse, spanning from law and civics to STEM and entrepreneurship. However, I've come to the conclusion that the most meaningful understanding generally lies at the intersection of diverse perspectives and disciplines; for instance, my experience in programming allowed me to notify tens of thousands of low-retention voters in my community, a direct example of how technical skills can be applied to civic engagement.</p>
    <p>A successful college experience means depth *and* breadth, valuing holistic understanding (as opposed to blatant recall) and recognizing that impactful solutions often arise when different perspectives and skill sets converge. An interjection here, but CMU in particular is probably the best institution to challenge yourself academically. Many advanced courses at the institution are cross-listed as for undergraduates and graduate students; in addition, there are many instances where an undergraduate student may simply request a professor to enroll in a graduate class, a practice heavily frowned upon at other institutions.</p>
    <p>The academic community I'm part of will play a pivotal role in my experience. Engaging with peers and mentors from various backgrounds will challenge me to think differently and grow as an individual. Engaging in student organizations, research initiatives, and collaborative projects will immerse me in an environment that fosters innovation and the exchange of ideas.</p>
    <p>Therefore, my goal is to integrate diverse perspectives, challenge my assumptions, and build meaningful connections within the academic community. This approach to education will equip me with the knowledge, skills, and experiences necessary to achieve my ultimate goals and make a lasting impact.</p>
    <hr><h4>2. Most students choose their intended major or area of study based on a passion or inspiration that's developed over time - what passion or inspiration led you to choose this area of study?</h4>
    <p>For the entirety of my life, I was captivated by entrepreneurship and STEM. When I was seven, I started a lemonade stand with my sister—selling cups of “Freshly Squeezed Lemonade” at 50 cents per cup. And in the fourth grade, I played with Arduinos, creating a handheld replica of <i>Pong</i> with a 16x16 LED matrix housed in a cardboard box. These early interests have motivated my actions and outlook in life—and this ethos creation still drives me today.</p>
    <p>This duality of entrepreneurship and STEM drives my current work. Currently, I'm a co-founder of a startup, [redact], where we are developing a multimodal embedding space that codes for standardized segments of footage that allows us to add a tertiary layer of attention. This architecture allows us to outperform state-of-the-art models by 20%. Balancing technical innovation with strategic planning has been a rewarding approach for me—showing me the value of an interdisciplinary education.</p>
    <p>Carnegie Mellon's Tepper School of Business presents the most ideal environment to further these values. I'm particularly drawn to Tepper's focus on the intersection of business, technology, and innovation to integrate business studies with disciplines across CMU. Meanwhile, interdisciplinary opportunities—such as taking electives (or even applying for a dual degree) at the School of Computer Science—offer me the chance to rigorously explore the interplay between technology, design, and business.</p>
    <p>At Tepper, I hope to refine my leadership acumen, deepen my understanding of market dynamics, and leverage CMU's collaborative ecosystem to take ventures like Eule Labs to the next level. The Tepper community's spirit of innovation and interdisciplinary learning resonates deeply with my vision of creating impactful solutions at the intersection of business and technology.</p>
    <hr><h4>3. Consider your application as a whole. What do you personally want to emphasize about your application for the admission committee's consideration? Highlight something that's important to you or something you haven't had a chance to share. Tell us, don't show us (no websites please).</h4>
    <p>Throughout my application, I have highlighted my love for innovating, problem-solving, and turning ideas into reality. But, I realize I haven't fully shown what I do beyond who I am. So, I'll use this opportunity to talk about two projects I've worked on.</p>
    <p>My interest in low-level programming began when I wanted to combine my love for tinkering with software and my hobby: Minecraft. But, technically speaking, there was a challenge - the version of Minecraft I had, Minecraft: Bedrock Edition (MCBE), was programmatically different from the original game (written in C++ as opposed to Java). In order to modify MCBE, one would need to create a shared library that is injectable to an executable. So, despite its millions of players, it had no modding community to speak of. As a result, I led a team of four developers to create [a] MCBE modification injectable: [redact] Client. To date, our native client has seen over [redact] injections, with a peak of over [redact] Patreon supporters. Additionally, our memory address hooks table serves as the foundation for [many modern Bedrock modificaiton clients].</p>
    <p>This knowledge proved useful during my junior year when I took on a project for AP Research. I designed and built a low-cost NMR quantum computer with a custom PCB that had custom firmware made in C++, leveraging the expertise I gained during Horion. The principles of the project are actually quite interesting. In a strong magnetic field, a spin-possessing nucleus obtains the energy to resonate if perturbed by a perpendicular magnetic field generated by a solenoid coil (B1). Change the phase and amplitude of B1, and you can create arbitrary qubit states.</p>
